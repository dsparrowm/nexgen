# 🎉 Email Verification Flow - Implementation Complete!

## Overview

Complete email verification system with welcome emails has been successfully implemented for the NexGen signup flow.

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Database Schema Updates** ✅
Added new fields to User model in Prisma schema:
- `isEmailVerified` (Boolean) - Track email verification status
- `verificationCode` (String?) - Store 6-digit verification code
- `verificationCodeExpires` (DateTime?) - Code expiration timestamp (1 hour)

**Migration:** `20251003163121_add_email_verification_fields`

### 2. **Backend Endpoints** ✅

#### **Updated: POST /api/auth/register**
- Generates 6-digit verification code
- Saves code + expiration to database
- **Sends verification email** to user after signup
- Returns user data with `isEmailVerified: false`

#### **New: POST /api/auth/verify-email**
- **Request:** `{ email, code }`
- Validates 6-digit code and expiration
- Marks user as verified (`isEmailVerified: true`)
- **Sends welcome email** after successful verification
- Returns success message

#### **New: POST /api/auth/resend-verification**
- **Request:** `{ email }`
- Generates new 6-digit code
- Updates database with new code + expiration
- **Sends new verification email**
- Prevents email enumeration (always returns success)

### 3. **Email Templates** ✅

All three email templates are now integrated:

#### **Verification Email** (After Signup)
- Subject: "Verify Your NexGen Account"
- Contains: 6-digit code displayed prominently
- Design: Blue gradient, professional branding
- Sent by: `sendEmailVerificationCode()`

#### **Welcome Email** (After Verification)
- Subject: "Welcome to NexGen - Your Account is Active!"
- Contains: Welcome message, platform features, login button
- Design: Gold gradient, feature highlights
- Sent by: `sendWelcomeEmail()`

#### **Password Reset Email** (Already Working)
- Subject: "Reset Your NexGen Password"
- Contains: 6-digit reset code + link
- Design: Gold gradient with security tips
- Sent by: `sendPasswordResetEmail()`

### 4. **Frontend Integration** ✅

**Updated: `/apps/user/app/verification/page.tsx`**
- Now calls `POST /api/auth/verify-email` with correct parameters
- Changed `verificationCode` → `code` parameter
- Resend button calls `POST /api/auth/resend-verification`
- Redirects to `/verification/success` on success
