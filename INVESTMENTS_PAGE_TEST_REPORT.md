## 6. Calculation Verification

### 6.1 Investment Summary Calculations

✅ **Total Invested:**
```
Formula: Sum of all investment.amount
Verified: ✓ Correctly sums all investments
```

✅ **Current Value (Active Investments):**
```
Formula: amount + (amount × dailyReturn × daysElapsed)
Where: daysElapsed = floor((now - startDate) / milliseconds_per_day)
Verified: ✓ Correctly calculates current value with time-based returns
```

✅ **Current Value (Completed Investments):**
```
Formula: amount + sum(transaction.amount where type='MINING_PAYOUT')
Verified: ✓ Uses actual payout sum from transactions
```

✅ **Total Returns:**
```
Formula: currentValue - totalInvested
Verified: ✓ Correctly calculates profit/loss
```

✅ **ROI (Return on Investment):**
```
Formula: (totalReturns / totalInvested) × 100
Verified: ✓ Returns percentage, handles division by zero
```

✅ **Average Return:**
```
Formula: Sum of all individual ROIs / number of investments
Where: Individual ROI = (returns / amount) × 100
Verified: ✓ Calculates per-investment average
```

✅ **Best/Worst Performers:**
```
Algorithm: Sort investments by ROI, take first and last
Verified: ✓ Correctly identifies extremes, handles empty array
```

### 6.2 Investment Progress Calculations

✅ **Days Elapsed:**
```
Formula: floor((now - startDate) / (1000 × 60 × 60 × 24))
Verified: ✓ Correctly calculates days since investment start
```

✅ **Total Days:**
```
Formula: floor((endDate - startDate) / (1000 × 60 × 60 × 24))
Verified: ✓ Uses investment duration from backend
```

✅ **Days Remaining:**
```
Formula: max(0, floor((endDate - now) / (1000 × 60 × 60 × 24)))
Verified: ✓ Never negative, stops at completion
```

✅ **Progress Percentage:**
```
Formula: min(100, max(0, (daysElapsed / totalDays) × 100))

## 7. Performance Optimizations

### 7.1 Data Fetching Strategy
✅ **Parallel Requests:**
- Investments and transactions fetched simultaneously
- Uses Promise.all for efficiency
- Reduces overall loading time

✅ **Automatic Refetch:**
- Triggered on filter changes
- Triggered after successful actions (create/withdraw)
- Ensures data consistency

✅ **Pagination:**
- Large datasets split into pages
- Reduces payload size
- Improves render performance

### 7.2 Component Optimizations
✅ **Conditional Rendering:**
- Only renders visible elements
- Empty states instead of rendering empty lists
- Loading states prevent layout shift

✅ **Memoization Opportunities:**
- `portfolioData` calculation can be memoized
- `portfolioDataWithPercentages` derived calculation
- Consider `useMemo` for expensive calculations

✅ **Event Handler Optimization:**
- Handlers defined outside render when possible
- Uses `useCallback` in hook
- Prevents unnecessary re-renders

---

## 8. Security Verification

### 8.1 Authentication
✅ **Token Management:**
- Stored in localStorage as 'authToken'
- Sent in Authorization header
- Validated on backend for all endpoints

✅ **User Isolation:**
- Backend uses `userId` from authenticated user
- Cannot access other users' data
- All queries filtered by userId

### 8.2 Input Validation
✅ **Frontend Validation:**
- Amount fields validated before submission
- Required fields checked
- Min/max bounds enforced

✅ **Backend Validation:**
- Express-validator rules on POST endpoints
- Amount validation against mining operation constraints
- Balance checks before investment creation
- UUID validation for IDs

### 8.3 Data Sanitization
✅ **API Responses:**
- Proper error handling prevents data leakage
- Generic error messages for users
- Detailed errors logged server-side only

---

## 9. User Experience Enhancements

### 9.1 Visual Feedback
✅ **Loading Indicators:**
- Skeleton loaders for delayed content
- Spinning icons for actions
- Button text changes during processing

✅ **Success/Error Messages:**
- Color-coded (green/red)
- Icons (checkmark/alert)
- Auto-dismiss or closeable

✅ **Animations:**
- Framer Motion for smooth transitions
- Enter/exit animations for modals
- Hover/tap scale effects on buttons

### 9.2 Information Hierarchy
✅ **Dashboard Layout:**
- Portfolio summary at top (most important)
- Charts for visualization
- Investment list for details
- Transactions at bottom (historical)

✅ **Card Design:**
- Clear headers with icons
- Primary metrics prominent
- Secondary info in smaller text
- Status badges color-coded

### 9.3 Empty States
✅ **Helpful Messages:**
- Clear explanation of empty state
- Encouragement to take action
- CTA buttons prominently displayed

✅ **Icons:**
- Relevant icons for each section
- Large, semi-transparent for background
- Consistent with overall design
