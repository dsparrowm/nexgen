## üìã Current State Analysis

### Frontend Component Analysis
The `Settings.tsx` component currently shows:

## üìä Estimated Time

- **High Priority Tasks:** 33-42 hours
- **Medium Priority Tasks:** 19-27 hours
- **Low Priority Tasks:** 12-15 hours

**Total Estimated Time:** 64-84 hours (~8-10 working days)

**Recommended Approach:**
1. **Day 1-2:** Tasks 1-3 (Profile fetch, update, password change)
2. **Day 3:** Tasks 4-5 (Profile image, KYC upload)
3. **Day 4:** Tasks 6-8 (Notifications, 2FA, account info)
4. **Day 5:** Tasks 9-10 (Loading states, error handling)
5. **Day 6-7:** Medium priority tasks (Theme, email change, sessions, referral)
6. **Day 8:** More medium priority + Testing
7. **Day 9-10:** Low priority tasks + Polish + Final testing

**Note:** 2FA implementation (Task 7) is the most complex and may require additional backend development. Consider it a stretch goal if time is limited.

## üìù Notes

- Settings page has the most backend dependencies of all dashboard pages
- Many features require new backend endpoints (2FA, email change, sessions, etc.)
- KYC functionality is already partially implemented in backend
- Profile and password update endpoints exist and are ready to use
- 2FA will require significant backend work (authentication flow changes)
- Consider implementing features in phases based on priority
- Some features (language, activity log, connected accounts) may not be needed initially
- Focus on core profile management, security, and KYC first
- Theme switching can be implemented client-side only (no backend needed)
- Notification preferences depend on backend implementation

**Ready for implementation after backend verification and approval! üöÄ**

**Note:** This is the most complex dashboard page due to security features and backend dependencies. Recommend phased implementation starting with profile management, then KYC, then security features.
